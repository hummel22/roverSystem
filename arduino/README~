Arduino Code to interact between computer and servos


TODO
	Add Switches
		- Single Servos 1-8
		- Total Arm Control
	Build Servo Class
		- VARIABLES
			- CurrentAngle
			- TargetAngle
			- Iterations
		- FUNCTIONS
			- initialize(int pinPlace, int StartingAngle)
			- update(int TYPE, int Iterations)
				- Type (0 or 1) - total control vs single servo requires different equations
				- Total Control Uses Iterations (calcuated and recieved from Computer/not on Arduino)
				- Single Servo Ignores iterations
			- setAngle(int newAngle)
				-set the Servos new Target angle
			
	Allow Sending Errors
	Add MIN/MAX 

VERSIONS
V3.1.1
	Created servoRun.h
V3.1
	PIN 10 may be dead
	Removed Safety Net
V3.0 
	Heavy Commenting
	Handles Random Memory Error - Checks if new angle is within -+ 8 degrees of old
	Currently only Servo 1 is active

	
v2.01
	Test different Delays
	Elimanting delay - causes stutter
	High delays - slower motion
	15 - fairly smoooth
v2.0
	Error handlindg - checks if new value is within 10
		Means that sweep must be done between 0 and 180 to begin controlling
		Starting value starts at 0
	
v1.42
	Printlines added to determine error
	Error possible locations
		Data sent is wrong (Although checks say not this
		Data is corrupted on way over (Don't know how to check)
		Memory is corrupted while waiting to be read (Again hard to check)
		Reading is wrong (Error alwasy reads 11 on angle read) (dont know why)
	Maybe just ignore angles that are differnt

V1.41
	Added double to fix truncation
	bug for stuttering	
		Max value changes randomly- No idea Why	
		Possible misread
	
V1.4
	no Git upload
	Removing delay in ReadData - increase smoothness

V1.3
	Easing Added for Single Servo
		Current Equation x0 = x0 + (xFinal-xMax)*0.1
			Possibly(it is) Causing truncation(rounding) 
			only sensitive to 5 degree changes
	Delay added to (50)
	Pausing Eliminated
V1.2	
	Removed Initial Directions

V1.1
	Changed to Switch Case
	
V1.0
	Reads string from monitor in terms /1/2/3/4/5/
	Sets all Servos at once
