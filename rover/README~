Code For Rover Put together

OVERVIEW
	##BUG##
		Fails to initiate Arduino Succesfully - only occurs sometimes
			WORK AROUND
			Most Run Rover Program
			Run arduino Prograom
			Run Arduinos Serial and clos
		Possible port open is wrong
		Seems like Arduino is continuously being reset
		Add When Opening?
	##BUG##

	Interpreter (Operator to Rover)
		- Remove out of order packets (if statement checking if current header is greater than previous)
		- Timeout for no connection	(if certian number of timouts reached, stop rover, check connection)
		- Add switch statements
			- Full Arm Control 
			- Rover Steering
			- Video Control
			- Check diagnostics
		
	Interpreter (Arduino to Operator)
		- Create
		- Possible Switches
			- Stat update
			- Send Errors
	Add Video Streaming
	Search Serial Ports for Arduino


VERSIONS
V4.7
	Created pass function - pass commands from operator to rover
	Add "-" to front of commands sent to arduino
	Added 4/ to send ping
V4.6.2
	Added Outline for Commands
	0-20 Servos
	20s - Arduino System
	30s - System 
	...
V4.6.1
	Commenting Updated
	Output formatted better
V4.6
	Add timeout on rover for no commands received
	After ~ 10 seconds Pings Operator
	Operator answers ping resets counter on rover
V4.5
	Add Header checker
		Checks header is greater then previous header
		Send reset header once headers are over 1000
	Add servo anngle Command - shortened switch statement
		cause segmantaion fault when building string
	
V4.4
	Fixed Send/Recieve Bug

V4.32
	Variable Width and Height for Layout

V4.31
	Added more commenting
	Fixed Read Function in Interpreter Class
	Added Switch Statements for Servos 1-8

v4.3
	Built Interpreter Class
	Added Commenting to Arduino.h

v4.2
	Removed excess files from repository
	Added Commenting to roverMain
v4.1
	Removed auto adding wrappers (operator has wrappers now)
V4.01
	Eliminated some cout for simplier terminal reading
V4.0
	Add Send to Arduino
	Auto added 1/ and end / to commands from operator for testing
V3.0
	Receives UDP from operator
	recvfrom() set to non Blocking - returns "fail" with no data

V2.0
	Send UDP to operator
	Return from Arduino and send to UDP	
V1.0
	UDP initialize Done
	Succesfull UDP Sent an Received by Test Server
	Serial Initialize Done
	Receive Arduino
V0.11
	Set Up main files structure
	
V0.1
	Initialized Files
	Main
	Arduino
	UDP
	Headersl
